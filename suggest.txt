Suggestions for improving Shot Type and Depth Description UI:

1. Integrated Approach
- Instead of showing "Add Depth Description" as a separate checkbox, integrate depth options directly into the Shot Type selection
- Group shot types into categories with visual indicators:
  * Close Range: Extreme Close-Up, Close-Up, Macro Shot
  * Mid Range: Medium Shot
  * Wide Range: Wide Shot, Extreme Wide Shot, Full Shot (with depth options)
- For Wide Range shots, show depth options as sub-selections with visual previews
- Use a two-level select or expandable cards with visual representations

2. Visual Selection Cards
- Replace the dropdown with visual cards for each shot type
- Include example thumbnails showing the composition for each shot type
- For wide shots, show depth variations as sub-cards with visual examples
- Example layout:
  [Thumbnail]
  Shot Type Name
  Brief Description
  [Depth Options appear below for wide shots]

3. Interactive Slider Approach
- Create a visual slider representing camera distance
- As user slides from close to far:
  * Extreme Close-Up → Close-Up → Medium → Full → Wide → Extreme Wide
- Show a visual preview that updates with slider position
- For wide shots, show depth options as radio buttons below the slider
- Include visual indicators of what each position is best suited for

4. Guided Selection
- Start with a simple question: "How much of the subject do you want to capture?"
- Provide visual options:
  * "Just the details" (close-up options)
  * "The full subject" (medium shots)
  * "Subject with environment" (wide shots + depth options)
- Show relevant options based on selection
- Include example photos for each option

5. Smart Presets
- Based on the selected photography style and subject category, suggest optimal shot types
- Example:
  * For Product Photography + "Jewelry": Suggest close-up shots
  * For Landscape + "Mountain": Suggest wide shots with depth options
- Show these as preset cards with visual examples
- Allow manual override with full options

Implementation Priority:
1. Visual Selection Cards - Most intuitive and user-friendly
2. Smart Presets - Adds value through contextual suggestions
3. Guided Selection - Helps users make informed choices
4. Integrated Approach - Cleaner UI but requires careful design
5. Interactive Slider - Innovative but may require more development effort
